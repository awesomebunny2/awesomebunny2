- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @awesomebunny2 
  - *Otherwise known as awesomebunny or Ninjabunny if there are not enough characters for awesomebunny...smh*
- Iâ€™m interested in JavaScript, AppleScript, Bash, Python, Visual Basic, and eventually any coding that will allow me to make custom applicatons
- Iâ€™m currently learning Automotation with JavaScript and AppleScript for use in programs such as Adobe InDesign and Microsoft Excel.
- Hoping to start learning Swift in the near future so I can expand my horizons in Mac and Apple automation and app development
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any interesting ideas/features that programing can bring to Adobe programs, organizational programs (such as Microsoft Office), general Mac navigation and functionality (such as finder for Mac or any other built-in programs), and app development (specifically for multi-platform productivity, organization, and feature integration). 
- How to reach me ... *it's a secret to everybody...*
